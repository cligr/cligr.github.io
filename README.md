clig group website
===================

This is the [CLIG group website](https://clig.github.io/), built with [Jekyll][] and [bibble][].

It's based on this [research group website template](https://github.com/uwsampa/research-group-web), which you can use to build your own nice group website! ðŸŽ£ We thank [Sampa](https://sampa.cs.washington.edu) for generously sharing their amazing work.
