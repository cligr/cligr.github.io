  abstract = "Innovation and knowledge creation call for high-level epistemic
              agency and design-mode thinking, two competencies beyond the
              traditional scopes of schooling. In this paper, we discuss the
              need for learning analytics to support these two competencies,
              and more broadly, the demand for education for innovation. We
              ground these arguments on a distinctive Knowledge Building
              pedagogy that treats education as a knowledge-creation
              enterprise. By critiquing current learning analytics for their
              focus on static-state knowledge and skills, we argue for
              agency-driven, choice-based analytics more attuned to higher
              order competencies in innovation. We further describe ongoing
              learning analytics initiatives that attend to these elements of
              design. Prospects and challenges are discussed, as well as
              broader issues regarding analytics for higher order competencies.",
