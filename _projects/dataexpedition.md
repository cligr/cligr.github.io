Computing has become an integral part of the practice of modern science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), inspiring educators to integrate computing with STEM learning. This project aims to develop a pedagogical model -- *DataExpedition* -- to engage students in building scientific explanations based on real-world open science data, computing, and classroom dialogues. DataExpedition would not only nurture crucial scientific practices emphasized by the Next Generation Science Standards, but also make science learning more connected with real-world problems and aligned with real-world scientific practices.

### Phase 1

Phase 1 of the project is supported by the University of Minnesota Libraries, under its [Research Sprints program](https://www.lib.umn.edu/research-sprints).
During the research sprint, the project team will work to identify, retrieve, and preserve a set of open geoscience data to support one data expedition module on the Arctic.

### Phase 2
