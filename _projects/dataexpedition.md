Computing has become an integral part of the practice of modern science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), inspiring educators to integrate computing with STEM learning. This project aims to develop a pedagogical model -- *Data Expedition* or *DataX* -- to engage students in building scientific explanations based on real-world open science data, computing, and classroom dialogues. DataX would not only nurture crucial scientific practices emphasized by the Next Generation Science Standards, but also make science learning more connected with real-world problems and aligned with real-world scientific practices.

### Phase 2 (Jan 2019 - Jun 2020)

Phase 2 of the project is supported by the Grant-in-Aid (GIA) initiative of the Office of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota. 

#### Co-design with teachers

In this phase, we are co-designing pedagogical interventions with K-12 teachers.

Partner schools include:

- Central High School, St Paul
- Harding High School, St Paul
- Jackman Institute of Child Study Lab School, Toronto

#### DataX platform

We are also developing a DataX platform that supports learners' computational participation across disciplines. Below is a screenshot of the platform we are currently developing.

### Phase 1 (May 2018)

Phase 1 of the project was supported by the University of Minnesota Libraries, under its [Research Sprints program](https://www.lib.umn.edu/research-sprints).
During the research sprint, a project team -- made of geospatial data curators, data scientists, and instructional designers -- worked together to identify, retrieve, and preserve a set of open geoscience data to support data expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic. Over the span of 4 days, we have:

- Drafted curriculum-relevant inquiry questions related to the climate change
- Compiled dozens of open datasets related to the climate change
- Cleaned a subset of the identified datasets (appx. 12) and created a data wrangling/cleaning guide for future use
- Imported 8 datasets to the [Common Online Data
Analysis Platform (CODAP)](https://codap.concord.org/) for data expeditions and created 3 'data stories' from these expeditions
- Developed a mockup for the DataExpedition environment
- Created a preliminary pedagogical design for DataExpedition in high school science

Special thanks to the awesome project team -- Mariya Gyendina (PM), Lindsay Matts-Benson, Carolyn Rauber, Melinda Kernik, Danny Hanson, Ryan Mattke, and Frank Sayre -- who brought tremendous expertise, curiosity, and willingness to play.
